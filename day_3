- saving consistently can lead to significant growth over time.
• Easy tactics for saving. 
* Differentiating between short-term and long-term savings goals
• The importance of having an emergency fund. 

There are many different methods people use to set money aside. Here are a few examples:
* Some people automatically deposit a certain percentage of their paycheck into a savings account, so they don't even have to think about it each time they get paid.
* Others keep a piggy bank or jar at home, where they add their spare change each day or week.
* Another strategy is to create a budget and designate a certain amount each month to put into savings.
* Some people use apps or services that "round up" their purchases to the nearest dollar and put the extra change into a savings account.
* Finally, some people use specific goal-setting strategies. For example, they might save all $10 bills they receive, or try to save every day for a month.
- compound interest and its impact on savings.
Simply put, compounding interest is interest earned not only on the principal (the money saved), but also on interest already earned. In other words, it’s money earned on money earned! The earlier they begin saving, the more time they have for compound interest to grow. This is why the figures in the savings growth chart are highest for the youngest savers. Yes, more money is contributed over time, but the longer they invest, the more their savings will grow! When saving and investing, the Rule of 72 is also an important concept. The Rule of 72 is a quick and easy way to determine how long it will take for your initial investment to double based on the interest rate you’ll earn. Let’s say you save $1,000 in an account with an 8 percent interest rate. Divide 72 by 8 and you’ll see it will take 9 years for your investment to double.
- the "Rule of 72" is a simple way to estimate how long it takes for money to double.
The rule of 72 is best for annual interest rates. On the other hand, the rule of 70 is better for semi-annual compounding.


- loans: borrowing money and repaying with interest.
1. a loan is a type of debt. A bank or other financial organization loans money to a borrower, who must pay it back over time. The bank generally charges a cost for the loan, which is "interest." Interest has to be paid back along with the loan.
2. the components of a loan are the principal, interest, term, and monthly installment.
3. interest is generally calculated as a percentage of a loan. For example, if $100 is borrowed with a 5% interest rate over a year, $105 must be repaid (the principal: $100, + 5% of the $100 = $5).


The importance of building a good credit history. • 
What a FICO score is and why it matters. 
• How to monitor their credit report. 
• How to compare credit cards to select the one that’s the best fit for their situation. 
(You may want to use an online credit calculator to show the class how much time it takes to pay off different debt levels by only making the minimum payments.) • 
Consider the factors that determine your FICO score (types of credit used, payment history, amount owed, length of credit history, and if you’ve taken out new credit recently). 
Why do you think this information matters to lenders? What does this information tell them about the consumer? • 
highlighting the impact of credit on future financial decisions.
Children need to understand that credit means borrowing from others and comes at a cost. However, they also need to be taught that credit can be a valuable tool. credit in and of itself is not bad so long as it is used responsibly, and children need to be taught how to use credit to their advantage.


businesses might take out loans to expand their offices, open new shops, or to introduce new products. The idea is that the company may not have the cash on hand to expand the business or introduce a new product line, but with the loan's help they can achieve their goals. They also expect to generate more profit through the expansion or upgrade, and this profit will enable them to pay back the loan.
a business needs to repay the principal of the loan plus interest. most loans are repaid on a monthly basis, and that payment is an additional cost to the company.
