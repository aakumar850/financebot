What is money, and why does it matter? we use money to get goods and services
A good is something someone gives you and a service is something someone does for you
we get money from having jobs, giving someone else a good or service, or an allowance or something like a pension
this money that we receive and use to get goods and services can come in different forms: cash, like bills and coins; debit cards, where you put money from your bank checking account on them and can use that amount to pay; credit cards, where your bank account get charged and you pay later; digital platforms like venmo or cashapp or zelle; buy now pay later or bnpl which is commonly seen in online retail and is paid in installments; a check that you take to the bank which will then charge the account of the checkwriter


wants vs needs:
A need is something you need to have, something you can't do without. A good example is food. If you don't eat, you won't survive for long. Many people have gone days without eating, but they eventually ate a lot of food. You might not need a whole lot of food, but you do need to eat.
A want is something you would like to have. It is not absolutely necessary, but it would be a good thing to have. A good example is music. Now, some people might argue that music is a need because they think they can't do without it. But you don't need music to survive. You do need to eat.
These are general categories, of course. Some categories have both needs and wants. For instance, food could be a want in some cases, depending on the type of food. You need to eat protein, vitamins, and minerals. How you get them is up to you. You can eat meat, nuts, or soy products to get protein. You can get fruits and vegetables to get vitamins and minerals. You can eat yogurt or cheese to get other vitamins and minerals. You can eat bread to get still more vitamins and minerals. These basic kinds of foods are needs. But a food like ice cream is a want. You don't really need to eat ice cream to survive. You can eat it to get some vitamins and minerals, but other foods like cheese and yogurt give you more of those same vitamins and minerals without giving you the fat that ice cream does. Still, ice cream tastes good. You  want it, but you don't need it. You like it, but you don't have to have it to survive. This means you can have it, your food want, after you make sure you meet the necessary nutritional categories first, or your food needs.
Families spend their money first on needs like food, shelter and medicine. Meanwhile, nice-to-have purchases, such as toys and vacations, should be bought only after needs have been met. While everyone needs clothing, designer jeans fall into the want category. Likewise, a home is a necessity, but a personal bathroom or even one's own bedroom can be characterized as a want, rather than a need.


Supply is the amount of a certain item that is available and made right now. Demand is how many people want the item.
