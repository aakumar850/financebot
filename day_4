1. What Investing Is: 
* A way to gain money over the long-term
* Analogy of planting a seed and watching it grow into a tree over time
* have you ever seen shark tank? and heard the sharks talk about equity? equities are the same thing as shares/stock in a company!
Stock is an investment that people pay to a company because they believe that that company will make money. It's kind of like a loan, except that payback isn't guaranteed. A bunch of people give a company money, and in return those people (called investors) get a certain amount of shares of stock. The company sells these shares of stock at a certain price; and the more money you pay, the more shares you can buy.
For example, if the price of Disney stock is $10, then you can get 3 shares for $30. When you write Disney a check for $30, they give you 3 shares of stock. (this will not be done directly with disney, but through separate markets)
Most people who buy shares of stock want to sell them for more than they bought them for, so they hold onto them. If the share price goes up to $15, then you can sell your 3 shares of stock and make $15, since you spent $30 originally and you got $45 back.
You might think, however, that Disney will make even more money later on. You could hold onto your stock and hope that the share price goes even higher. Usually, the more money a company makes, the higher its stock price goes. You might decide that you're going to sell only if the share price reaches $30. In that case, you watch the share price until it reaches the $30 level, then sell. What do you make? Well, you get $90, so you make a profit of $60 (since you spent $30 to buy the stock in the first place).
Stock prices don't always go up, though. They can go down just as quickly as they can go up. If you decide to hold onto your stock and the prices goes down below $10, then you would get less money than you originally spent. For example, if the price went down to $5 and you sold your shares, then you would get back $15, meaning that you lost $15 in the deal. This is the danger in buying stocks.

  - different investment options (stocks, etfs, bonds, mutual funds, real estate (mortgage), crypto, gold) (assets vs funds)
Investing is the process of allocating money or resources to different assets or ventures with the expectation of earning a return or profit over time. There are several types of investing, each with its own risk and potential for reward. Here are some common types of investing:
Stock Market Investing: This involves buying shares or ownership stakes in publicly traded companies. Investors aim to benefit from the company's growth, receiving potential dividends and selling shares at a higher price than the purchase price.

Bonds and Fixed-Income Investing: Bonds are debt securities issued by governments, municipalities, or corporations. Investors lend money to the issuer in exchange for periodic interest payments and the return of the principal amount at maturity.
legal contract between you (the investor) and a company or government. Issued by company/government, but you loan them the money. You’ll receive it back through interest and also, when the loan ends/bond matures, the initial payment.
Differ from loans because loans are given by private banks to firms or individuals and you pay it back, bonds are issued by governments/companies but given by individuals to the firm or government, then paid back to the individual (you).
Bonds work by firms selling a bond for say £1,000. In return, the firm agrees to pay back the bond in 10, 20 or 30 years time. In the meantime, the government/firm will pay interest on this bond of say 5%. The purchaser of the bond gives the firm £1,000 and in return gets interest payments for the duration of the bond term.
Bonds tend to be only repaid in full at the end of the period – e.g. 10, 20 or 30 years. Banks may expect repayment of both interest and principal during the repayment period.
Their price on the secondary market is a combination of the bond's face (par) value and the demand for it in the secondary market, which will add a premium or discount.
Government bonds can be bought and sold on the ASX as exchange-traded treasury bonds (eTBs), and they are traded in the same way as regular stocks.
Corporate bonds can be purchased directly from the issuer through a public offer at face value. You can also trade them on the secondary market via the ASX, where they're called XTBs.
Another option is to invest in a professionally managed bond fund, which pools investors' money in order to purchase a collection of bonds. It's important to remember that managed funds typically have management and sometimes performance fees.
Bond ETFs, which passively track bond indices, are a cheaper way to gain diversified exposure to the bond market. Betashares, ETF Securities, iShares, Vanguard and State Street all offer bond ETFs.
Benefits
Because they're issued by governments or large companies, they're considered a safe asset, second only to cash. 
Compared to other types of investments, generally speaking, bonds are a safe investment. Especially US government bonds.
The risk is low and you will likely get your money back.
You receive regular interest payments. The issuer pays you on a set payment schedule so you’re guaranteed a steady income.
You have options. You can choose from different types of government and company bonds.
Disadvantages
Because bonds are safe, the return is low. Compared to other investments like stocks, the return on investment is lower.
There’s a possibility you won’t get your money back. If you bought a risky bond with a low credit rating, it’s possible the company or government won’t back you back. You never know exactly what’s going to happen (Invest in bonds with high credit ratings.)
Secondary market value risk. Investors can hold bonds until they mature or sell them before this point on the secondary market. If you need to sell your bond before it matures and the interest rate is higher than your bond, you will most likely have to sell below face value. Aka, less than what you bought it for. (To avoid this as best you can, make sure the maturity date is realistic. Can you wait 2, 5, or 10 years to get your money back?)
bond prices vary inversely with interest rates: interest rates go up, the bond will trade at a discount because newly issued bonds will pay investors higher coupon rates than old ones, and vice versa. 
The higher the duration, the more sensitive the bond 
You can buy bonds through a brokerage account or directly from the issuer (company or government). You can also buy bonds from the secondary market. Buying bonds from the secondary market means you are not buying them from the issuer. You are buying them from someone who already owns the bond. 
When you buy bonds from the secondary market, the price becomes the market value, not the bond’s face value. The market value of a bond is determined by multiple factors. Factors include; current interest rates, maturity dates, and similar bonds being sold. Also, you can invest in bonds as part of a mutual fund or ETFs
(fidelity bond ratings: creditworthiness, since bonds are a type of loan)

Real Estate Investing: Investors purchase real estate properties, such as residential or commercial buildings, to generate rental income or earn profits from appreciation in property value over time.

Retirement Accounts: Investing for retirement is done through accounts like 401(k)s (employer-sponsored) or IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts), which offer tax advantages for long-term savings.

Commodities Investing: Investors buy and sell physical commodities (e.g., gold, oil, agricultural products) or invest in commodity futures contracts as a way to diversify their portfolios.

Cryptocurrency Investing: This involves buying and holding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, aiming to benefit from potential price appreciation. Crypto is subject to high volatility, consumes a lot of energy, and is often used in criminal activities.

Index Funds and Passive Investing: Investors buy index funds that track specific market indexes, aiming to match market performance rather than trying to outperform it actively.

Mutual Funds: Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets managed by a professional fund manager.

Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): are similar to mutual funds but trade on stock exchanges like individual stocks. They offer diversification and are often passively managed to track specific indexes.

* Discussing the concept of risk and return in investments 
* Risk and Reward: Help them understand that all investments come with some level of risk, and it's essential to balance potential rewards with possible losses.
* All investments involve risk; that is, it's possible your return on an investment—the money that you gain or lose—might be different than you had originally anticipated.
* Expand on the idea of risks, or factors that might make a stock price go down. The main issue again is profitability: if a company becomes less profitable or actually loses money, it can push the stock price lower. Some of the risk factors in this area are: an unpopular product, increased competition, and poor management.
* Explain that there are also larger issues beyond the specifics of a company's performance that can impact stock prices. Notably, stocks move up or down due to factors in the national and global economy. Changing interest rates, threats of inflation or recession, and even oil prices in another part of the world are examples of factors that can affect stock prices.
* Market movers are any event or factor capable of influencing the market and generating a movement.

* Exploring the role of diversification in reducing investment risk
Diversification: Explain the concept of diversification by comparing it to not putting all their eggs in one basket. Encourage them to diversify their investments, even if it's just in their piggy bank or savings jar. 
Diversification is not simply spreading your money around into different companies; you have to diversify your investment funds into different types of companies. For example, if you currently own shares in Wal-Mart and wanted to make another investment, you'd be better diversified by investing in oil giant Exxon Mobil (XOM) than Walmart rival Target Corp (TGT).
Of course, when we're making real-life diversification decisions, investors use a more scientific approach. The widely used GICS (global industry classification standard) system divides the economy into 10 general sectors, which we'll use as a model to diversify our portfolio.
Suppose you already own WMT, TLAB, and PIR we don't want to purchase any more companies from the Consumer Discretionary or Telecom sectors. However, we do need to purchase at least 8 more stocks, around one from the remaining 8 sectors. Feel free to use a stock screener to get a list of stocks within a given sector.

Custodial Accounts, also known as UTMA/UGMA accounts, allow parents or guardians to manage investments on behalf of a minor. The funds in these accounts belong to the child, but the parent or guardian oversees the investments until the child reaches the age of majority (usually 18 or 21, depending on the state). Some brokerage firms offer custodial accounts that parents can use to invest for their children.
Some robo-advisor platforms offer investment accounts designed specifically for kids with parental control. These platforms often have simplified interfaces and educational tools to help kids understand their investments better.
Some financial apps provide family features that allow parents to create accounts for their kids and set up allowances or investment options with restricted access. These apps might have simple investing features suitable for beginners.
Some educational platforms are designed to teach kids about finance and investing in a gamified way. While they might not involve real money investments, they can help build an understanding of basic investment concepts.
