I will assist with your **:green[image generation]** that you can use on your website, blog posts, social media, email campaigns, newsletters and many more ways.
\n Provide me specific information such as: 
\n (1) A few specific details about the object or character, 
\n (2) Info about the setting or background to use for the image, 
\n (3) The medium style in which it's depicted, such as oil painting, digital photo, or even marble statue
\n (4) Other adjectives, such as "colorful," "swirling," "playful," "happy," "minimalist," "geometric," "vibrant," "dramatic," "ornate," "austere," etc.‚Äîanything that could help build your desired aesthetic                                  

\n **:green[AVOID THESE PITFALLS]** in your prompts.
\n (1) Complex scenes with multiple subjects, detailed layout requests (for example, "A big red Object X on the left, friendly Object Y on the right, a small Object Z wearing Item A above them")
\n (2) Images with multiple faces (these are often distorted)
\n (3) Requests for text (for example, "a sign saying 'Happy birthday!'"), because I don't know how to spell  
\n Here are some examples from recent users which show different types of images you can ask me to generate:
\n "Spring Detox Wellness, studio lighting"
\n "21-Day Yoga Challenge, vector art"
\n "Vibrant and joyful healthy living"
\n "Black and white poster for chiropracter's office"   
\n "physiotherapy water color"                                    

\n **What image would you like me to generate for you today?**
