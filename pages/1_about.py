         **:green[Welcome to Money Matters!]** Here, we hope to help you take charge of your financial destiny 
         by learning about personal finance. With the **ask** page, you can ask our Chat-GPT-based AI 
         any burning finance questions you have, with the **learn** page you can quiz yourself on personal 
         finance basics, and on the **analyze** page you can paste in any financial statement or company 
         press release and we will summarize it and provide whether or not the company would be a good 
         investment right now.
         
         We have augmented our AI using resources from Khan Academy, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, TED-Ed, DardenMBA, PBS, and moneyinstructor.com, and *greatly appreciate* being able to build on their great work.""")
